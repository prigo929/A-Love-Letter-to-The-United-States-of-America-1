A constitutional system that protects private property, enforces contracts, and rewards individual initiative created the conditions for an explosion of wealth, productivity, and innovation unmatched in 5,000 years of recorded economic history.",
  "At $28.8 trillion in 2024, the US economy is not merely the largest — it is categorically different from every other economy on Earth. It is simultaneously the world's largest consumer market, its most important financial hub, the leading destination for foreign direct investment, the dominant technology innovator, and the issuer of the global reserve currency. No other nation has ever held all five crowns at once.",
  "The numbers are staggering but the story behind them is even more remarkable: a system built on free markets, low barriers to entry, tolerance for creative destruction, and an immigration policy that has attracted the world's most ambitious people for 250 years. The American economy does not succeed despite capitalism — it succeeds because of it.",

It represents approximately 25% of all global economic output generated by a country with just 4.2% of the world's population.",
  "What makes this achievement even more extraordinary is its durability. The United States has been the world's largest economy for over 130 consecutive years — through the Great Depression, two World Wars, the Cold War, the financial crisis of 2008, and the COVID-19 pandemic. No other economy in modern history has demonstrated this combination of scale and resilience.",

Combined market capitalization exceeds $47 trillion — more than the GDP of every nation except the United States itself. These markets are not merely places where stocks are traded; they are the engine through which American innovation is financed.",
  "The US bond market — $27 trillion in outstanding Treasury securities alone — is the bedrock of global finance. US Treasury yields serve as the world's reference rate for risk-free returns. When institutions from Tokyo to Frankfurt price any financial asset, they start with what the US government pays.",

The venture capital ecosystem centered in the San Francisco Bay Area, with satellites in New York, Boston, Seattle, Austin, and Miami, channels more patient, risk-seeking capital into early-stage innovation than the rest of the world combined.",
  "The numbers are breathtaking: American startups raised approximately $170 billion in venture capital in 2023 — nearly half of all VC deployed globally. The result? 659 unicorn companies (private businesses valued over $1 billion), representing 52% of the entire global unicorn ecosystem.

This status confers on the United States an "exorbitant privilege" — the ability to borrow in its own currency at globally competitive rates.',
  "Today, 57.4% of all global foreign exchange reserves are held in US dollars. Over 40% of international trade is invoiced in dollars regardless of whether the United States is a party to the transaction.

These structural facts embed dollar demand into the financial architecture of every nation on the planet.",

American firms like JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, and Harvard Business School export the intellectual capital that runs economies around the world.
