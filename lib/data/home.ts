// Data file for the homepage.
//
// This file is where a non-programmer should usually edit homepage content:
// - key stats
// - section copy
// - video cards
// - chart data
// - gallery images
//
// Images are pulled from SITE_IMAGES, so changing a homepage image usually
// means replacing the image key used here.
//
// Why this file exists:
// React components should focus on layout and behavior. Keeping the content in
// one place makes updates easier and reduces the chance of editing the wrong file.

import { SITE_IMAGES } from "@/lib/site-images";
import type { ContentBlockItem } from "@/types/content.types";

// Small facts bar near the top of the homepage.
// Change these values if you want to update the animated counters.
// `as const` at the end tells TypeScript to keep these values very specific,
// which helps catch mistakes when other files read this data.
