              On &ldquo;De-Dollarization&rdquo; — A Reality Check
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4 font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-white/65">
              Every decade since Bretton Woods, analysts have predicted the
              dollar&apos;s imminent replacement. The Euro launch in 1999,
              China&apos;s rise in the 2000s, BRICS proposals in the 2020s —
              each was confidently declared the dollar&apos;s death knell. Each
              time, the dollar&apos;s share of global reserves declined
              modestly, then stabilized.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-base leading-relaxed text-white/65">
              The reason is structural: no rival offers the combination of deep
              liquid markets, rule of law, political stability, military power,
              and network effects that the dollar provides. The Chinese renminbi
              is not freely convertible. The Euro lacks a unified fiscal
              backstop. The dollar&apos;s position is not merely habitual — it
              is the rational choice of every rational central banker on Earth.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 font-body text-sm font-semibold text-glory-gold">
              The dollar endures — not because of inertia, but because nothing
              better exists.
